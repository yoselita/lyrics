Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu-
All human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
