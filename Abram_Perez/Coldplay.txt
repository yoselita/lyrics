song title: Fix you

Lyrics
===========
When you try your best, but you dont succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you cant sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you cant replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above, or down below
When youre too in love to let it go
But if you never try, youll never know
Just what youre worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
===========
