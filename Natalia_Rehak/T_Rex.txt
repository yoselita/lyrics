Song title: Cosmic Dancer

Lyrics
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was out
I was dancing when I was out
I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself right out the womb
I was dancing when I was eight
I was dancing when I was eight
Is it strange to dance so late?
Is it strange to dance so late?
Oh, ohh-oh
I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
I danced myself into the tomb
